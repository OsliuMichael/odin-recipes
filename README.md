Project: Recipes

In this project the following skills were being developed:

Html boilerplate writing from memory
Adding img tags
Adding order and unordered list tags
Using Heading tags
Adding anchor tags

Conclusion:
The project went well, just need to not forget the basics, such as adding 'lang' to the html tag, not forgetting to add the Home button to the new pages and following up on what to do with '.webp' image files.
