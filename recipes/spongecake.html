        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There's nothing quite like a classic sponge cake—light, fluffy, and perfectly golden.
             It's the kind of bake that never goes out of style, whether you're layering it with jam and cream for a Victoria sponge or keeping it simple with a dusting of icing sugar.
             The best part? It's surprisingly easy to make, with just a few basic ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen.
             If you're new to baking or just want something quick and satisfying, this sponge cake is a great place to start. Let's get whisking! </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until thick and lemon-colored, about 3 minutes. Gradually add sugar, beating until mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Fold flour, baking powder, and salt into the batter by hand.</li>
            <li>Microwave milk in a microwave-safe bowl until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Add butter and stir until melted. Stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Pour hot milk mixture into the batter; blend on low speed until well combined and smooth. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
